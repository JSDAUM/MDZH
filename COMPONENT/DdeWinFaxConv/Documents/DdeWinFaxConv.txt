==================
General Directions
==================
DdeWinFaxConv handles the DDE communication between a Delphi
application and WinFax PRO v8.  With DdeWinFaxConv, a developer
can tell WinFax where to send a fax without the user being 
asked to provide a number or select a number from a WinFax 
phone book.

To send a fax:
	1.)  Start the WinFax PRO Controller.
	     (The WinFax PRO setup adds it to StartUp)

	2.)  Place a DdeWinFaxConv component on a Form or 
	     DataWindow.

	3.)  Call the TDdeWinFaxConv.SetWinFaxLink method.

	4.)  Enter DdeWinFaxConv's SendFaxParams (see Properties).

	5.)  Call the TDdeWinFaxConv.Execute method.

	6.)  Repeat steps 4 & 5 to send to multiple recipients.

	7.)  Send a print job to the WinFax printer driver.

DdeWinFaxConv can also add dialing prefixes and long distance 
dialing prefixes.  See the component Properties for more details.

By default, WinFax will preview a fax before sending it.  To 
disable this option:
	1.) Open WinFax PRO
	2.) Choose Setup|Send...
	3.) Uncheck "Allow me to preview and annotate faxes"

There are other WinFax DDE features not covered by DdeWinFaxConv.
For more information on WinFax DDE commands, see the WinFax PRO 
online help.
